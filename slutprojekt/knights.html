            	The Knights, also known as The Legion, are one of the three playable factions in For Honor. It is their belief that many, if not all of the ancient ruins were built by their ancestors. The Knights had been scattered for centuries but have begun to reunite under a single banner, that of the Iron Legion. There are those still, however, who choose to gather their own "Legion", and their alliance with the Iron Legion is shaky at best. The Knights live in the lands of Ashfeld.

            	Weapons
            </h2>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Longsword</b> - The long sword is a straight doubled edged sword with a cross-guard. The heavy pommel at the handle is for balancing, making the center of gravity near the handle and making it capable of being wielded by both two hands and one. The pommel also allows what is called 'Mordhau' (murder-stroke), where the wielder grips the blade and swing the pommeled end of the sword like a mace. This allows the sword to penetrate armor where other swords cannot.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Flail</b> - The a weapon that was both difficult to master and difficult to fight against, the flail was a heavy metal bludgeon, sometimes spiked, connected to a wooden handle by a chain. The chain made this weapon difficult to defend against.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Shield</b> - Wooden shields were an excellent defense and not as unwieldy as one might believe. With it, warriors could simultaneously attack and defend and strikes.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Poleaxe</b> - These medieval polearms consisted of an axe with a pike connected to a long wooden shaft. This long shaft allowed it to attack enemies from a safe distance and the axe head made it ideal to smash through armor by concentrating all its force into a narrow point along the blade.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Shortsword & Dagger</b> - Quickly drawn and swift in execution, but suffer a lack of lethality, these twin blades make up for it with rapid successive strikes.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Gladius</b> - The standard issue weapon of the Roman centurions. This short sword was swift and quick. It allowed the soldier to engage in close combat and was primarily designed for thrusting.
