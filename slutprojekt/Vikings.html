            <p class="text">
            	The Vikings, also known as The Warborn, are one of the three playable factions in For Honor. Previously thought to have vanished, the Vikings have returned - in great numbers - from across the sea. They have come to take new lands, plunder, expand the clans and reclaim their ancient homeland in the North. Hundreds of clans now dominate amidst the cold and icy tundra.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	The Vikings are the undisputed power of the rivers and seas. In their pursuit to gain the approval of their gods in Valhalla, the Vikings live for battle and glory as they seek out riches and new land, destroying everything in their path to gain it.

            <p class="text">
            	<b>Dane Axe</b> - A two-handed axehead atop a long pole shaft, suitable and only able to used for the strongest and bravest warriors. The long shaft and the hook-like bottom of the axe head also give it the ability to be used to sweep out opponent's feet.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Hand Axes</b> - The weapons of choice for the Berserker who dual wields them. Their size makes them perfect for being wielded like any other weapon or thrown at enemies.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Gladius</b> - This short sword is ideal for one-handed use and can cut down enemies in a few short strokes. The Viking swords were descendants of the spartha style sword which came to replace the gladius in the Roman Empire.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Round Shield</b> - It is believed no Viking should be without his shield. Despite popular belief, round shields were neither clunky nor cumbersome, especially in the hands of a trained warrior. They were often used to deflect sword blows and can be used as a blunt weapon to knock enemies off balance.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
            	<b>Spear</b> - The polearm of choice for the Vikings, the spears outreached the sword while staying short enough for one-handed use. Valkyries can be seen using a spear and shield. If all else fails, the spear can be hurdled at the enemy at long range. Vikings are reported being capable of throwing two spears at once, one in each hand.
